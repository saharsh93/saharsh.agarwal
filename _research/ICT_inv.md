This study uses data on about 1.5 million US patents granted between 1981 and 2006 to demonstrate that inventors, whose experience is grounded in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), increasingly dominate the production of knowledge across diverse industries and technology classes. On average, the percentage of "ICT inventors" affiliated with a patent has grown steadily each year and more than quadrupled from 8% in 1981 to 34% in 2006. Patents with ICT inventors are also more likely to be breakthrough inventions, general-purpose and highly cited. Our results underscore the importance of acquisition of technology talent to competitiveness in modern innovation and new product development.
